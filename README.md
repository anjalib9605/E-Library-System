# E-Library-System
 E-Library System â€“ Browse and borrow digital books
 A simple web application to browse books by genre and simulate borrowing them. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project dynamically fetches book data from the Google Books API.

## Features  

- Fetches books based on genre using **Google Books API**.
- Displays book details including title, author, and description. 
- Users can click *"Want to Borrow"* to simulate a borrowing request. 
- Responsive design with a clean UI. 

## Technologies Used  

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**  
- **Google Books API** for fetching book data. 

## How to Use  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-explorer.git
2. Open index.html in a browser.
3. Click on a genre to load books.
4. Click a book to view details.
5. Press "Want to Borrow" to simulate borrowing (currently not linked to a backend).

# Limitations

Uses Google Books API, so book availability is limited. Lacks complete details (some books have missing images, descriptions, or authors).
No actual borrowing system (backend integration required).
UI/UX can be improved.

# Future Improvements

Implement a backend to store borrowed books.
Improve book availability using a larger database.
User Authentication (Login to track borrowed books).
Email Notifications for Borrow Requests.
